I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.\\n\\nAs well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.\\n\\nIf you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link]. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If the image is copyrighted under a non-free license (per Wikipedia:Fair use) then the image will be deleted 48 hours after .

I have assumed good faith (and good intentions) on your part, and have never suggested (or seen reason to suggest) that you might have some ulterior motive in mass-adding links to one specific company's web page. Nor, for that matter, have I ever made any suggestion that this is an \"\"administrative\"\" matter or even mentioned such a role. (Clearly, as a party to this disagreement, I would not do so at any rate as it would be a conflict of interest.) I would ask that you thus extend the same good faith toward me, rather than making spurious and unfounded accusations. ''''''chatspy \\n\\n\"</td>\n",

As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a \"\"Third Way\"\" as the references show.\\n\\nThe only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to \"\"cover up\"\" its socialistic origins and third way status. This is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on Mussolini. -   \\n\\n\"</td>\n",

I have been to the selective breeding page but it's almost a stub. It points to 'animal breeding' which is a short messy article that gives you no info. There must be someone around with expertise in eugenics? 93.161.107.169   \n",

       "10  \"\\nFair use rationale for Image:Wonju.jpg\\n\\nThanks for uploading Image:Wonju.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.\\n\\nPlease go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.\\n\\nIf you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the \"\"my contributions\"\" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting \"\"Image\"\" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. (talk • contribs • ) \\nUnspecified source for Image:Wonju.jpg\\n\\nThanks for uploading Image:Wonju.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.\\n\\nAs well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.\\n\\nIf you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link]. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

His absence is notable, since he is the only living ex-president who did not attend. That's certainly more notable than his dedicating an aircracft carrier. \\nI intend to revert this edit, in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself, and not throw accusations around quite so liberally. Perhaps, if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this, we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully.   \n",

She stuck her nose where it doesn't belong. I believe the argument was between me and Yvesnimmo. But like I said, the situation was settled and I apologized. Thanks,   \n",

The third neff to be signed to Cam's label under Roc A Fella. In 2003, he was 20 years old coming out with his own singles \"\"Santana's Town\"\" and \"\"Down\"\". So yes, he is born in 1983. He really is, how could he be older then Lloyd Banks? And how could he be 22 when his birthday passed? The homie neff is 23 years old. 1983 - 2006 (Juelz death, god forbid if your thinking about that) equals 23. Go to your caculator and stop changing his year of birth. My god.\"   \n",

I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly \"\"enhanced;\"\" and I also believe those changes are no improvement.  \\n\\nIn support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists.\\n A1. Benjamin Cardozo\\n A2. Learned Hand\\n\\n B1. John Marshall Harlan\\n B2. John Marshall Harlan II\\n\\nThe question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.\\n\\nPerhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. \\n\\nLess humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.\\n\\nAt a minimum, I'm questioning this edit?

Unfortunately, my attempts failed - I'm still effectively the only one who does it. The classical music wikiproject was not interested, (Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Classical_music/Archive_5#Need_help.21Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_3#I_could_use_some_helpWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_2#Raulbot.2C_and_the_music_list) So I really had given up trying to interest others.  \\nThe sound list was featured on digg a while back - http://digg.com/music/Wikipedia_has_free_classical_music_downloads . It got 1600 diggs, which is IMO very impressive.   \n",

I never claimed O'Donohue had that position, rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position, which is exactly what the quote says and also something O'Donohue agrees with. \\n\\nAgain, I was combating the notion that it was a \"\"absurd part\"\" to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. Since many researchers hold this position, it would be unfair to call it absurd. The disorder part is divided in the field, some argue that it is not a disorder at all, some do. At the end of the day, it is a value judgment (as Cantor pointed out earlier in the thread), not a scientific judgement. If we choose to make this value judgment in the article, it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis.   \"   \n",

This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position.

Lisak doesn't have a neutral point of view to begin with.  If an offer to polygraph or even concerned review of polygraph results shocks a complainant into thinking her lies have been uncovered, the recantation is still perfectly valid.  If you know you are telling the truth, you will argue with machine or investigator.  Also part of Kanin's research was a followup of the recanted story where possible to verify if any were false recantations.  In all followups the recanted version of events matched what the accused said happened.\\n\\nArguing that Lisak is a respected PHD is baseless if Kanin is a respected PHD.  I agree that my edit wasn't as neutral as possible though, so apologize for that.  Still something must be done here.   \n",

I have assumed good faith (and good intentions) on your part, and have never suggested (or seen reason to suggest) that you might have some ulterior motive in mass-adding links to one specific company's web page. Nor, for that matter, have I ever made any suggestion that this is an \"\"administrative\"\" matter or even mentioned such a role. (Clearly, as a party to this disagreement, I would not do so at any rate as it would be a conflict of interest.) I would ask that you thus extend the same good faith toward me, rather than making spurious and unfounded accusations. ''''''chatspy \\n\\n\"   \n",

As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a \"\"Third Way\"\" as the references show.\\n\\nThe only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible. This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to \"\"cover up\"\" its socialistic origins and third way status. This is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on Mussolini. -   \\n\\n\"   \n",
